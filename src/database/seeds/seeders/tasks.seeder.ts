The basic structure of the tag consists of opening tag <span class="code-highlight"> &lt;sometagname&gt;</span>, text or other nested tags in between and closing tag <span class="code-highlight">&lt;/sometagname&gt;</span>. This so called <strong>paired</strong> tag, on the line number <span class="code-highlight">12</span> you can see an example of title paired tag.`,

These are called so because they consist of only one tag which starts with <span class="code-highlight">&lt;</span> symbol and ends with <span class="code-highlight">/&gt;</span> symbol. On the line number <span class="code-highlight">17</span> you can see an example of unpaired tag <strong>img</strong> that is used to insert images to the page.`,

Copy this line of code <span class="code-highlight">&lt;p class="main__text"&gt;Product can be returned within 7 days since purchase*&lt;/p&gt;</span> and insert it right after <span class="code-highlight">p</span> tag on the line <strong>19</strong>.

We will cover them in the next lesson.`,

Note that the value of <span class="code-highlight">id</span> attribute unlike <span class="code-highlight">class</span> is unique and can be used only once on a page. Also note that the the color of the text is not changed solely by the <span class="code-highlight">id</span> attribute.
